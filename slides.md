# Why This Matters {.r-fit-text data-background="images/9.png"}

- AI coding assistants are transforming how we build software
- Choosing the right tool can mean the difference between frustration and flow
- Let‚Äôs find out which one delivers for real-world developers!

# What is AI Agent? {data-background="images/4.png"}

An AI agent is a system that can:

- Perceive its environment through tools/APIs
- Make decisions autonomously
- Take actions to achieve specific goals
- Learn from interactions and feedback
- Chain multiple operations together

---

# Agents Continued {data-background="images/4.png"}

Key characteristics:

- Tool use capabilities (file system, web search, code execution)
- Planning and reasoning about complex tasks
- Persistent memory within a session
- Self-improvement through feedback loops

---

# Agents Continued {data-background="images/4.png"}

Styles:

- **IDE**: Feels like Copilot on steroids. It has smooth integration inside your editor, low-friction for everyday coding.
- **CLI**: Runs in your terminal where you drive the conversation. Great for deliberate workflows and bigger refactors.
- **Autonomous**: Tools that pursue higher-level goals across multiple steps. Handy for repetitive tasks, but still hit-or-miss.

# What is MCP? {data-background="images/6.png"}

![](images/Model%20Context%20Protocol%20Diagram.png){.r-stretch .r-frame .r-center}

::: notes
The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build
secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. The
architecture is straightforward: developers can either expose their data through
MCP servers or build AI applications (MCP clients) that connect to these
servers.
:::

---

# MCP Examples {data-background="images/8.png"}

- A [suite of specialized MCP servers](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) for AWS:
    - Saves the cost of having all the AWS docs in your own context
- Use [Playwright from your AI Tools](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp)
    - Control a browser and grab the context from various web pages

---

# In practice {data-background="images/8.png"}

- Connect your AI assistant to AWS MCP servers
- Ask natural language questions about AWS services
- Get contextually accurate answers based on latest documentation
- Generate AWS CLI commands, CloudFormation templates, or IAM policies
- Troubleshoot AWS-specific issues with current best practices

---

# DEMO: The Prompt {data-background="images/4.png"}

> This project was bootstrapped with scaf and has a NextJS frontend in the `frontend` dir and a Django backend in the `backend` dir.
>
> The scaf template only supports a GraphQL API. Refactor the app to use a REST API.

# Tool introduction: Aider {.r-fit-text data-background="images/9.png"}

- Developed by Paul Gauthier
- Open-source ([GitHub: paul-gauthier/aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider))
- Supports multiple LLM models (OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, Llama)
- Semi-agentic with git integration
- No MCP support currently
- Supports `/voice` interactions
- Use Multiple Models in the same session

---

# DEMO: Aider {data-background="images/5.png"}

- Specify conventions in CONVENTIONS.md
- Use different models for architect and edit mode simultaneously
- Use external editor with `/editor`
- Run commands and add to output with `/run`
- Show cost with `/tokens`
- Clear context with `/clear`
- Start with `--lint-command` and `--test-command` run your test suite after
  each time the AI edits your code
 
---

# Tool introduction: Goose {.r-fit-text data-background="images/2.png"}

- Developed by Block Inc. (formerly Square)
- Open-source ([GitHub: block/goose](https://github.com/block/goose))
- Supports multiple LLM models (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
- Fully agentic with integrated tooling
- Supports [MCP](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/getting-started/using-extensions#mcp-servers)
- Supports OpenRouter! (<https://openrouter.ai>)

---

# DEMO: Goose {data-background="images/9.png"}

- Specify conventions in `.goosehints`:
  Global: `~/.config/goose/.goosehints`
  Local: `.goosehints`
- Session support:
  Start a session: `goose session -n rest-api`
  Exit a session: type exit
  Resume session: `goose session -r rest-api`
- Permission Modes:
  Completely Autonomous / Manual Approval / Smart Approval / Chat Only
- Clear context by exiting `/exit`
 
---

# Tool introduction: Claude Code {.r-fit-text data-background="images/10.png"}

- Developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/claude)
- Proprietary model and tooling
- Uses only Claude models (Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- Fully agentic with reasoning capabilities
- Supports MCP (Model Context Protocol)

---

# DEMO: Claude Code {data-background="images/6.png"}

- Allow tools: `claude config add allowedTools "Bash(git:*),Bash(cat:*),Bash(grep:*)"`
- Specify conventions in CLAUDE.md
- Doesn't use git to commit changes. TIP: Ask it to "Review the staged changes
  with `git diff --staged` and git commit using conventional commit standard"
- Show cost with `/cost`
- Compact and clear context with `/compact` and `/clear`

---

# Tool introduction: Cursor {.r-fit-text data-background="images/1.png"}

- Developed by Cursor team
- Proprietary editor with open-source components
- Supports both OpenAI and Anthropic models
- Fully agentic with project navigation
- Supports [MCP](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

---

# DEMO: Cursor {data-background="images/8.png"}

- Specify conventions in Cursor Rules: ./cursor/rules
  https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai

# Tool Introduction: Devin {data-background="images/4.png"}

- Developed by Cognition Labs
- Closed-source, commercial tool (not open-source)
- Marketed as the "first AI software engineer"
- Fully autonomous execution (planning, coding, testing, deployment)
- No MCP support; tightly integrated proprietary stack
- Focused on end-to-end task delivery vs. code assistance

---

# Demo: Devin {data-background="images/4.png"}

- Provide task in natural language: "Build a web app for X"
- Devin creates repo, chooses stack, and scaffolds project automatically
- Runs code, fixes errors, and deploys without human intervention
- Interfaces with issue trackers and CI/CD pipelines directly
- Tradeoff: less user control, harder to audit/debug than IDE/CLI-first tools
